# Running Windows on the Xiaomi Pad 5

## Restoring the Device in EDL Mode
> This guide includes two methods to flash your device in, if method 1 fails, use method 2

### Entering EDL Mode
> There are two methods for booting your Xiaomi Pad 5 into **EDL mode**. Use whichever one applies to you.

> [!NOTE]
>
> ▶️ Click to expand the menu.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Method 1: Unlocked bootloader</strong></summary>

> If your bootloader is unlocked, simply run the following command in **fastboot mode**
```cmd
fastboot oem edl
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Method 2: Locked bootloader or unbootable device</strong></summary>

- Insert an **EDL cable** if you have one into your device and press the button on the cable to boot into **EDL mode**.
> EDL cables that can be found online which should work must include V2 in the name, for example **Hydra V2 EDL Cable**.
- Alternatively, **short the test points** (To do this, you need to disassemble the tablet through the display; instructions can be found on YouTube).

</details>

### Checking if everything is alright
- Open **Device Manager** on your PC and look for a new device, such as **Qualcomm HS-USB QDLoader 9008**.
- If the device is named **QUSB_BULK_CID** and/or has a yellow warning ⚠️ in **Device Manager**, you need install/update the drivers.
- To do this, download and extract **[QUD.zip](https://github.com/n00b69/woa-betalm/releases/download/Qfil/QUD.zip)** file, select the device with errors in Device Manager, select **Update drivers**, then select the **QUD folder** you extracted.
